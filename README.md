This is my portfolio.  

It was built to showcase the learning that I have done throughout my time in the University of Denver Software Program.  It was built completely by me using the Materialize CSS framework.

Attached you will find links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and all of the projects that I have built.  This page will be updated to reflect future learnings and projects as they are completed.
